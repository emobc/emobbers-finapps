README - Crowd Pocket Solution
===============================

The eMobbers team has developed a solution for financial so you can convert "cash" in "digital money".
There are a lot of differents situations like:

1. You dont have money and you want to interchange with digital money to pay in a commerce.
2. You want to retrieve the money you have in your trousers and you dont want to lose it (imagine all the money can collect a bank with this)

Future approaches:

1. People or commerces can earn a little money with this kind of transaction. 
2. Participate in crowd founding projects and donate the money, not possible the development in this time.

In this project we have developed:

1. Business Idea: Develop the business plan and organize in just 24 hs the business, the services and a multiplatform prototype.
2. Design and User Experience: Little approach with a prototype so you can experiment with this new idea.
3. Technology: Backend in PHP with API that returns XML.

HTML5 Client
IOS Client
Android Client 

4. Complete multiplatform and backend solution. Dynamic, you can change all the navigation in real time and add new services.

The idea can be developed with a lot of new different services (donations, crowd founding, etc).
